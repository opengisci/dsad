## Introductions



## Git and GitHub



## RMarkdown

The morning lectures will provide both working R code vignettes to solve specific problems *and* explanations about the context/purpose of the code, how it works, and how to use it.
The best way to keep track of what you're learning is with **computational notebooks** to interweave narrative explanations and notes with working code blocks and outputs. 
In R, computational notebooks are **Rmarkdown** files.
We will explore how to make them in our first afternoon lab.
I will check your progress on these notebooks at the end of each week.
