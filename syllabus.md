## Data Science Across Disciplines

In this course, we will gain exposure to the entire data science pipelineâ€”obtaining and cleaning, large and messy data sets, exploring these data and creating engaging visualizations, and communicating insights from the data in a meaningful manner.
During morning sessions, we will learn the tools and techniques required to explore new and exciting data sets. During afternoon sessions, students will work in small groups with one of several faculty members on domain-specific research projects in Biology, Geography, History, Mathematics/Statistics and Sociology. This course will use the R programming language.
No prior experience with R is necessary.

**GEOG 1230**: In this section, we will investigate human vulnerability to natural hazards in the United States using location-based text data about hurricane and flood disasters from social media.
We will analyze data qualitatively, temporally, and spatially to gain insights into the human experience of previous disasters and disaster response.
We will present findings using spatial data visualizations with the aim of informing future disaster preparedness and resilience.

## Learning Goals

- Learn fundamentals of data science using the R langauge.
- Investigate and describe the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of geographic social media data.
- Answer geographic questions about disasters by analyzing and visualizing geographic data from social media and the US Census.
- Communicate informative geographic stories about disasters with (interactive) data visualization.

## Required Materials and Resources

There are no required book purchases.  
A few articles will be assigned for afternoon discussions, but there is very little required reading.  
For morning lectures, you will need a laptop computer (MacOS, Windows, or Linux) with free R [https://www.r-project.org/], RStudio Desktop [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/], and Git [https://git-scm.com/] software installed.
You will need a free GitHub [https://github.com/] account.
For afternoon labs, you may use lab computers and installed software.  

## Expectations and Evaluation

**Participation 30%**: Full attendance and participation is required for success in the course. The participation grade is to be composed in equal parts of **attendance**, completion of **in-class assignments**, and completion of useful and tidy **computational notebooks** checked after each week. 

**Individual Assignments 45%**: One assignment will be assigned on Thursday and due by Monday morning of each of the first three weeks. The assignment will challenge you to apply what you have learned in morning lectures and afternoon labs to applied research with geographic disaster-related data.

**Small Group Projects 25%**: A final small group project will develop a single interactive spatial data science story about a disaster in the United States. The project will be presented live on one of the final two days of class (10%) and due with working code on GitHub by noon EST of the final day of class (15%).
