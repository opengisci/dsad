## Data Science Across Disciplines
In this course, we will gain exposure to the entire data science pipelineâ€”obtaining and cleaning, large and messy data sets, exploring these data and creating engaging visualizations, and communicating insights from the data in a meaningful manner.
During morning sessions, we will learn the tools and techniques required to explore new and exciting data sets. During afternoon sessions, students will work in small groups with one of several faculty members on domain-specific research projects in Biology, Geography, History, Mathematics/Statistics and Sociology. This course will use the R programming language.
No prior experience with R is necessary.

**GEOG 1230**: In this section, we will investigate human vulnerability to natural hazards in the United States using location-based text data about hurricane and flood disasters from social media.
We will analyze data qualitatively, temporally, and spatially to gain insights into the human experience of previous disasters and disaster response.
We will present findings using spatial data visualizations with the aim of informing future disaster preparedness and resilience.
