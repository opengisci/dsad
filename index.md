## Data Science Across Disciplines
In this course, we will gain exposure to the entire data science pipelineâ€”obtaining and cleaning, large and messy data sets, exploring these data and creating engaging visualizations, and communicating insights from the data in a meaningful manner.
During morning sessions, we will learn the tools and techniques required to explore new and exciting data sets. During afternoon sessions, students will work in small groups with one of several faculty members on domain-specific research projects in Biology, Geography, History, Mathematics/Statistics and Sociology. This course will use the R programming language.
No prior experience with R is necessary.

**GEOG 1230**: In this section, we will investigate human vulnerability to natural hazards in the United States using location-based text data about hurricane and flood disasters from social media.
We will analyze data qualitatively, temporally, and spatially to gain insights into the human experience of previous disasters and disaster response.
We will present findings using spatial data visualizations with the aim of informing future disaster preparedness and resilience.

## Required Materials and Resources

There are no required book purchases.  
A few articles will be assigned for afternoon discussions, but there is very little required reading.  
For morning lectures, you will need a laptop computer (MacOS, Windows, or Linux) with free R [https://www.r-project.org/], RStudio Desktop [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/], and Git [https://git-scm.com/] software installed.
You will need a free GitHub [https://github.com/] account.
For afternoon labs, you may use lab computers and installed software.  

## Expectations and Evaluation

*Firstly*, you need to keep up with the morning lecture material so that you can apply it to our hazards geography data projects.
The morning lectures will provide both working R code vignettes to solve specific problems *and* explanations about the context/purpose of the code, how it works, and how to use it.
The best way to keep track of what you're learning is with **computational notebooks** to interweave narrative explanations and notes with working code blocks and outputs. 
In R, computational notebooks are **Rmarkdown** files.
We will explore how to make them in our first afternoon lab.
I will check your progress on these notebooks at the end of each week.

*Secondly*, our afternoon sessions will culminate in an applied data science project using disaster-related social media data. 
The final product shall be composed of:
- **Data Analysis** using R code that is reproducible, legible, and well-documented
- **Data Visualization** of your results integrating multiple visualization types and some narrative with an emphasis on *legibility* and *telling an insightful story*. 
- **Presentation** of the final project to the full DSAD class.
