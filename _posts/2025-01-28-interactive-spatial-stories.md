## Project improvements

- You may use a batch of [geocoded profile locations]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/profile_geocodes.RDS)! Just join this table to the Tweets by the location column and integrate these coordinates into your analysis as the 3rd best option for mapping a Tweet.

- You may download other datasets from the Census or American Community Survey to include more detailed socio-economic information. Here is a [video tutorial](https://midd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=de8af8be-98b6-4758-bbc1-b126015b09e4) from GEOG 261. You don't need any of the QGIS stuff... the first few videos are a tour of Census data and techniques to download it using `tidycensus`.
