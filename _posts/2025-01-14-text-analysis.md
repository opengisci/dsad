## Reading for discussion

- Zou, L., Lam, N. S. N., Cai, H., & Qiang, Y. (2018). Mining Twitter Data for Improved Understanding of Disaster Resilience. Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 108(5), 1422â€“1441. https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2017.1421897 [download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12-Z5TxKeNYCCB_eEHpO653aJUz41wiw4&usp=drive_fs)

Questions for discussion: 

-	What research questions are the authors asking?
-	How do the authors deal with the problem of unequal Twitter participation over space? (both due to uneven population over space and due to uneven social media use by people) 
-	How do the authors analyze the timing of twitter activity?
-	How does sentiment analysis work and what do the outputs of sentiment analysis mean? 
-   What is the story/interpretation of the tables and figures in the paper?
