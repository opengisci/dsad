## Code test

- Take some time to organize your project data and `README.md` index
- Add a section to the `README` instructing another person how to run the data-processing code and the app. Assume that they already know R and RStudio and have those programs installed.
- Of particular imporance, instruct the purson which R or Rmd files must be run to prepare the data, and in which order.
- Each group shall trade off and attempt to run the project of another group.
- Through the Issues feature, give feedback in terms of any errors or uncertainties in running the app and in terms of the app and data visualizations:
  - is the app intuitive and easy to use?
  - do the data visualizations make sense? can you interpret them?
  - can you suggest any design improvements?

## Data files and ethics

- All data files will be removed from storage on https://geography.middlebury.edu as the course concludes.
- You are permitted to keep a copy for yourself to keep your project and code working. You are not permitted to redistribute the data to other people. 
- Your group and private repositories are `private` and "owned" by the opengisci GitHub organization. In the near term, this is a free resources provided by GitHub for members with education credentials (e.g. Middlebury Faculty). It may disappear if I fail to renew credentials or if GitHub changes this free program. 
- Therefore, I suggest making your own local copy of your work for the long term. You may also create a public version in a GitHub repository of your own creation, so long as you give credit to Professor Alex Lyford and myself for our contributions *and* take care not to reveal personal data of social media users.
- You *may* be able to `fork` a copy of your repository to your own account, or I may need to alter the repo settings to allow that. Let me know.
- If you choose to make a public version of your work from the course and any code blocks had output particular personally-identifiable details, you should suppress the output of those code blocks by adding `include=FALSE` to the code chunk.

## Bookdown

You can convert your repository into a Bookdown project by...

- install the `bookdown` package and load 
- create a new bookdown project
- either copy relevant content into the bookdown project, or copy the bookdown project files into the root of your directory
- set the `build` options to `website`
- make sure there are no duplicate code chunk names
- chapters start with top-level headings (one `#` hash), so use these sparingly
- use the `Index.Rmd` file as your introductory chapter
- individual RMD file titles and authors override the overall book title, so only use `title: ` and `author: ` in the header of the `Index.Rmd` file
- customize the `_bookdown.yml` file as follows to allow .RmD files in subdirectories to be included and to allow HTML outputs (like a leaflet map) to be included.

```
delete_merged_file: true
output_dir: "docs"
language:
  ui:
    chapter_name: "Chapter "
    
rmd_subdir: yes
always_allow_html: true
```

- once all of this is set up, the project will have a `build` panel with a `build website` button. Click and go for a walk.
