## Reading

Please read the following article prior to our Tuesday afternoon meeting.  
The article demonstrates the types of data and analysis that we will learn to accomplish during this winter term.

Wang, Z., Ye, X., & Tsou, M. H. (2016). Spatial, temporal, and content analysis of Twitter for wildfire hazards. *Natural Hazards*, 83(1), 523â€“540. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-016-2329-6 (download)[https://drive.google.com/open?id=12-Etp7vqxi245qov-hU8-496U8z-xuav&usp=drive_fs]

## Git and GitHub

The morning lectures will provide both working R code vignettes to solve specific problems *and* explanations about the context/purpose of the code, how it works, and how to use it.
The best way to keep track of what you're learning is with **computational notebooks** to interweave narrative explanations and notes with working code blocks and outputs. 
In R, computational notebooks are **Rmarkdown** files.  
To maximize the legitiblity and usefulness of your class notes and in-class assignments, you are expected to create daily or weekly RMarkdown documents toward your participation grade.  
These will be due at **12:00 noon EST on Friday** each week, by committing them to your GitHub repository.
