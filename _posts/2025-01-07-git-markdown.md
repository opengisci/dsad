## Reading for Discussion

Please read the following article prior to our Tuesday afternoon meeting.  
The article demonstrates the types of data and analysis that we will learn to accomplish during this winter term. In our first pass through the article, our goal is to get a sense of the types of graphs, maps, and information the authors have extracted from social media data.

## Git and GitHub

- Git software [git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
- GitHub account [github.com/](https://github.com/)
- What is version control?
- Advantages of using Git version control for Data Science

## Personal Course Repository

Professor Holler will create a private personal respository in which each student can store course notes and recieve individual feedback. In a workshop activity, we will practice using GitHub, Git, and RStudio to transfer information between laptops and lab computers, and [GitHub.com](https://github.com).

## RMarkdown

- RMarkdown [rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

The morning lectures will provide both working R code vignettes to solve specific problems *and* explanations about the context/purpose of the code, how it works, and how to use it.
The best way to keep track of what you're learning is with **computational notebooks** to interweave narrative explanations and notes with working code blocks and outputs. 
In R, computational notebooks are **Rmarkdown** files.  
To maximize the legitiblity and usefulness of your class notes and in-class assignments, you are expected to create daily or weekly RMarkdown documents toward your participation grade.  
These will be due at **12:00 noon EST on Friday** each week, by committing them to your GitHub repository.
